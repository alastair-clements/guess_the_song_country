# guess_the_song_country
A game for users to guess the country of origin of songs, just by listening to them. This project comes from a happy hour I hosted at work, and abysmally few people were able to guess the countries of origin of the songs on this playlist. I'm building this to prove that people can listen to a song and figure out where it's from fairly easily.
